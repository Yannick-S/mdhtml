# MDHTML : converting markdown to html files

This library provides a way for converting markdown files to html, to be view in
browsers and other. The main aim of this library is for me to learn how to
manage a library, write documentation, tests etc, do continuous integration and
other things along the way.

This project is inspired by a Podcast I heard
[here](https://testandcode.com/80), which creates the same library, however
writen in python.

### Usage

~~~
$ ./mdhtml -in test.md -out test.html
$ [TODO] ./mdhtml test.md > test.html 
$ [TODO] cat test.md | ./mdhtml > test.html
~~~

### History
* 0.1 Initial Tests
* 0.2 Getting Travis and codecov to work. Adding more badges while I was at it.
